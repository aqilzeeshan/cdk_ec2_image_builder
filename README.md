* This work is inspired by `https://newsvideo.su/tech/video/391628` and `https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ec2-image-builder-samples/blob/master/CloudFormation/Windows/windows-server-2016-with-vscode/windows-server-2016-with-vscode.yml` 
* The component part needs more work to make it work.
* Used existing component or component created through UI to make it work. 
* It also shows how to create Role, make service assume role, add policy statements to role and create instance profile for EC2
* For future todo there is great example of using instance profile in https://gist.github.com/sebsto/ebb66807ac8c6f9148c7580e2da5803d to try.
